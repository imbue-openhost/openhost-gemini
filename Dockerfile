# Agate Gemini server for OpenHost.
#
# Agate is a single-binary Rust implementation of the Gemini protocol
# (gemini://, RFC "Gemini Protocol v0.16.1"). We download the prebuilt
# upstream release binary rather than building from source because the
# binary is small (~3 MiB), the release has been signed by upstream
# (see the sha256 pin below), and there is no need to drag a full Rust
# toolchain through the layer.
#
# Base image: Debian 12 slim. We need a modern glibc (agate is linked
# against glibc 2.35+), curl+ca-certs for downloading the agate
# release, python3 + Starlette/Uvicorn for the HTTP sidecar (landing,
# health-check, and WYSIWYG editor), and tini so SIGTERM from
# `docker stop` reaches both children via our start.sh supervisor.

# Pin to a specific agate release + sha256 so rebuilds are reproducible
# and a compromised upstream release tarball would fail the verify step
# rather than silently landing in the image. Bump both values together
# when updating; the checksum is printed in the release notes of each
# GitHub release.
