# Entrypoint for openhost-gemini.
#
# On every boot we:
#   1. Resolve the Gemini hostname (env var GEMINI_HOSTNAME if set,
#      else "<app_name>.<zone_domain>"). Agate uses this as its
#      --hostname flag: requests whose Host header doesn't match are
#      refused, and the TLS cert agate auto-generates is issued for
#      this name.
#   2. Make sure the content root exists and, if it is empty,
#      copy the bundled default_content/ into it. We never overwrite
#      operator edits.
#   3. Make sure the certs dir exists. Agate generates a self-signed
#      ECDSA P-256 cert for the hostname on first boot if no cert is
#      found; subsequent boots reuse the existing cert/key.
#   4. Launch the HTTP sidecar (Starlette + Uvicorn) on
#      :${STATUS_PORT:-8080} for the OpenHost router's health-check,
#      landing page, and WYSIWYG editor.
#   5. Launch agate in the foreground as an unprivileged user.
#   6. Supervise both children: if either exits, kill the other and
#      exit so OpenHost restarts the container.

# Agate's auto-cert-generation writes to $CERTS_DIR/<hostname>/. We
# let it do so rather than pre-generating with openssl: agate picks
# up the same hostname we pass via --hostname, uses ECDSA P-256 by
# default, and writes cert.pem + key.pem alongside a small state
# file. If an operator drops in their own pair they just have to
# place a cert.pem + key.pem under $CERTS_DIR/<hostname>/ and
# restart the container.
#
# We deliberately run agate (and the sidecar) as the container's
# root user rather than dropping to a separate `agate` system user.
# Under rootless podman the container "root" is already mapped to
# an unprivileged host uid, so this is not a privilege escalation;
# and it sidesteps the rootless-volume ownership problem -- the
# OpenHost-mounted persistent volume comes in owned by the host
# root, which the container "root" can read and write but a
# different in-container user cannot. (Apps that create all their
# state from scratch -- e.g. xmpp's prosody storing accounts in a
# fresh sqlite db -- can run as a non-root user; we read seeded
# .gmi files written by start.sh, so the simpler approach wins.)

# --- supervise both children ------------------------------------------
#
# Same pattern as openhost-xmpp: register the SIGTERM trap first so a
# `docker stop` during the small window between backgrounding and
# trap-install doesn't orphan the children. PID vars initialised to
# empty so `kill` with an empty arg is a no-op if we get a signal
# before backgrounding completes.
